This is the homework Paul Dakessian gave me after our interview where he said I can improve the following:


-Don’t assume what they are going to ask and then start

Tell me about yourself:
-Pharmacy, don’t start with that
-Lots of I’m trying to do x
Trying to become a developer

Languages:
React, Ruby on Rails

-Looking for front end role, short answers. Sounds disengaged/uninterested

Why you looking for new role?
Doing part time internship, wants to find a full time role

What perfect role for you next?

Array/Linked/Hashmaps difference
Linkedlist less space
Array, not traverse
Hashmap - object
^^There's more differences

Stacks/Queues
No

Enum/Struct
No

Front end focused

Noisy background

Coding:
-No indents
-Didn’t ask questions, just started coding
-Didn’t write out steps talk through, or validate
-Very inefficient, multi loops to break, Can use split
-Good to talk through code
-Oof the section1/2 split
-Counts section isn’t going to work
-Doubling

Questions at end:
-Asked all three at once?

Extra tips:
"There are only two outcomes to an interview:
1. You get the job
2. You learn from your mistakes so you can get another job
Therefore don't stress about the interview.

"Don't focus on solving the problem fast or slow, rather focus
on solving the problem."
